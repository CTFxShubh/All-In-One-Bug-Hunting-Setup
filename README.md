# All-in-One-Bug-Hunting-Setup
Hello Everyone, This is my first repository.
Using this bash script you can setup your PC for bug hunting or even just after when you install your OS (Debian Linux) in most easiest way.
You just have to run the script and Sit Back! 
The script will do the rest of the work.
And its not gonna happen but if it asks for password in between please give the password and don't get mad at me ðŸ˜….

**<h3>The special thing about this script is that it will also install and setup go in your machine if it not installed.</h3>**
